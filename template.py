<h1>What is Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ?</h1>

<p> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. Some people with ASD have a known difference, such as a genetic condition. Other causes are not yet known. Scientists believe there are multiple causes of ASD that act together to change the most common ways people develop. We still have much to learn about these causes and how they impact people with ASD.

People with ASD may behave, communicate, interact, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. There is often nothing about how they look that sets them apart from other people.  The abilities of people with ASD can vary significantly. For example, some people with ASD may have advanced conversation skills whereas others may be nonverbal. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others can work and live with little to no support.

ASD begins before the age of 3 years and can last throughout a person’s life, although symptoms may improve over time. Some children show ASD symptoms within the first 12 months of life. In others, symptoms may not show up until 24 months of age or later. Some children with ASD gain new skills and meet developmental milestones until around 18 to 24 months of age, and then they stop gaining new skills or lose the skills they once had.

As children with ASD become adolescents and young adults, they may have difficulties developing and maintaining friendships, communicating with peers and adults, or understanding what behaviors are expected in school or on the job. They may come to the attention of healthcare providers because they also have conditions such as anxiety, depression, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which occur more often in people with ASD than in people without ASD.  </p>


<h1> Types of Autism</h1>
<b> 1.Asperger’s syndrome : </b>

<p> Asperger’s syndrome was the term used before 2013, but now it has been reclassified as level I ASD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.

Young people with Asperger's syndrome can communicate with others and perform well in school, but they have difficulty socially connecting with others. Their behavior and thought patterns can be inflexible and repetitive.
Symptoms of Asperger’s syndrome may include:

-  May spend a lot of time thinking and talking about one topic or passion or may only wish to pursue a limited number of activities
-  Struggle to grasp social settings in terms of communication such as body language, facial expressions, gestures, humor, and sarcasm
-  Have fewer facial expressions than others
-  Hobbies can become obsessive and interfere with their daily living
-  Become irritated by even little variations in their routine
-  Easily remember chosen information and facts
-  Difficulty controlling emotions, which can lead to verbal or behavioral outbursts, self-injurious actions, or tantrums</p>
<b> 2. Rett syndrome : </b>

<p>Rett syndrome is a type of ASD that affects 1 in every 10,000 women and rarely affects men. It is often diagnosed in children aged 6 to 18 months when they begin to fail developmental milestones or lose previously acquired abilities.
Many experts now believe Rett syndrome to be part of a disease spectrum caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene, in which there is duplication of the MECP2 gene on the X chromosome.
Rett syndrome causes serious deficits in almost every element of a child's life.

Symptoms of Rett syndrome may include:

-  Loss of mobility or gait abnormalities
-  Reduced muscle tone
-  Microcephaly (smaller head size)
-  Speech impairment
-  Hands lose their functionality
-  Involuntary hand movements
-  Seizures
-  Difficulty breathing
-  Sleeping problems
-  Scoliosis (abnormal curvature of the spine)
</p>

<b> 3. Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) : </b>
<p>
CDD is a rare condition that was merged into ASD in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.
The onset of CDD differs from person to person, but mostly, it is seen after three years of age. Due to its late onset, there will be a loss of previously gained skills in social, verbal, and motor (related to movement) functioning in the child.
Although the exact cause of onset is unknown, some believe that the condition is a type of childhood dementia caused by the buildup of amyloid (a type of protein) in the brain. However, there is no evidence to prove the argument.
After showing normal development for two years, the child may progress into CDD. This occurs mostly between three and four years but may occur any time before 10 years of age.

The onset of CDD may be sudden or gradual.
Children may be aware of the condition and ask what is wrong with them.
Parents or professionals may not notice developmental changes such as language, communication, social interactions, and emotional development.
Children may report hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or smelling what is not there).
A child who could communicate in two to three sentences may stop talking gradually.
A child who liked to cuddle may completely oppose physical contact.
The child may lose at least two of the following acquired skills:
- Motor abilities
- Playing abilitie
- Social and self-care abilities
- Expressive language skills
- Receptive language skills
- Control of the bowels or bladder

The child may have an abnormal function in at least two of the following:

- Communication
- Social interaction
- Repetitive interests or behaviors

</p>


<b> 4. Kanner’s syndrome (CDD) : </b>
<p>Kanner’s syndrome is also referred to as classic autistic disorder.
Children with Kanner's syndrome will appear smart, attentive, and clever, with the disorder's underlying traits such as:

- Inability to form emotional attachments with people
- Uncontrollable speech
- Obsession with handling objects
- Communication and interpersonal difficulties
- A high level of rote memory and visuospatial skills with significant learning problems in other areas</p>

<b>5. Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS</b>
<p>
When a kid with learning and behavioral difficulties does not fulfill all the diagnostic criteria for a particular category of autism, then the diagnosis made will be PDD-NOS.
PDD-NOS was the diagnosis given to people who fit into this group and were thought to have milder symptoms than those with ASD.

Symptoms of PDD-NOS may include:
- Unusual social behavior
- Improper development of skills such as motor, sensory, visual-spatial organizational, cognitive, social, academic, and behavioral
- Communication problems
- Underdeveloped speech and language skills
- Persistent and repetitive actions such as opening and closing doors repeatedly
- Abnormal sensitivity to taste, sight, sound, smell, and/or touch
</p>

<h1> How is ASD diagnosed? </h1>
<p>Health care providers diagnose ASD by evaluating a person’s behavior and development. 
ASD can usually be reliably diagnosed by age 2. It is important to seek an evaluation as soon as possible.
The earlier ASD is diagnosed, the sooner treatments and services can begin.
</p>

<h2>Diagnosis in young children</h2>
<p>Diagnosis in young children is often a two-stage process.
</p>
<b>Stage 1: General developmental screening during well-child checkups</b>
<p>
Every child should receive well-child check-ups with a pediatrician or an early childhood health care provider. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children receive screening for developmental delays at their 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well-child visits, with specific autism screenings at their 18- and 24-month well-child visits. A child may receive additional screening if they have a higher likelihood of ASD or developmental problems. Children with a higher likelihood of ASD include those who have a family member with ASD, show some behaviors that are typical of ASD, have older parents, have certain genetic conditions, or who had a very low birth weight.

Considering caregivers’ experiences and concerns is an important part of the screening process for young children. The health care provider may ask questions about the child’s behaviors and evaluate those answers in combination with information from ASD screening tools and clinical observations of the child. Read more about screening instruments  on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.

If a child shows developmental differences in behavior or functioning during this screening process, the health care provider may refer the child for additional evaluation.
</p>

<b>
Stage 2: Additional diagnostic evaluation
</b>
<p>
It is important to accurately detect and diagnose children with ASD as early as possible, as this will shed light on their unique strengths and challenges. Early detection also can help caregivers determine which services, educational programs, and behavioral therapies are most likely to be helpful for their child.

A team of health care providers who have experience diagnosing ASD will conduct the diagnostic evaluation. This team may include child neurologists, developmental pediatricians, speech-language pathologists, child psychologists and psychiatrists, educational specialists, and occupational therapists.

The diagnostic evaluation is likely to include:

Medical and neurological examinations
Assessment of the child’s cognitive abilities
Assessment of the child’s language abilities
Observation of the child’s behavior
An in-depth conversation with the child’s caregivers about the child’s behavior and development
Assessment of age-appropriate skills needed to complete daily activities independently, such as eating, dressing, and toileting
Because ASD is a complex disorder that sometimes occurs with other illnesses or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include:

Blood tests
Hearing test
The evaluation may lead to a formal diagnosis and recommendations for treatment.

</p>

<h2> Diagnosis in adults </h2>
<p>
Diagnosing ASD in adults is often more difficult than diagnosing ASD in children. In adults, some ASD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of other mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Adults who notice signs of ASD should talk with a health care provider and ask for a referral for an ASD evaluation. Although evaluation for ASD in adults is still being refined, adults may be referred to a neuropsychologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist who has experience with ASD. The expert will ask about:

Social interaction and communication challenges
Sensory issues
Repetitive behaviors
Restricted interests
The evaluation also may include a conversation with caregivers or other family members to learn about the person’s early developmental history, which can help ensure an accurate diagnosis.

Receiving a correct diagnosis of ASD as an adult can help a person understand past challenges, identify personal strengths, and find the right kind of help. Studies are underway to determine the types of services and supports that are most helpful for improving the functioning and community integration of autistic transition-age youth and adults.
